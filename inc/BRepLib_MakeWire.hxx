//! Describes functions to build wires from edges. A wire can
//! be built from any number of edges.
//! To build a wire you first initialize the construction, then
//! add edges in sequence. An unlimited number of edges
//! can be added. The initialization of construction is done with:
//! -   no edge (an empty wire), or
//! -   edges of an existing wire, or
//! -   up to four connectable edges.
//! In order to be added to a wire under construction, an
//! edge (unless it is the first one) must satisfy the following
//! condition: one of its vertices must be geometrically
//! coincident with one of the vertices of the wire (provided
//! that the highest tolerance factor is assigned to the two
//! vertices). It could also be the same vertex.
//! -   The given edge is shared by the wire if it contains:
//! -   two vertices, identical to two vertices of the wire
//! under construction (a general case of the wire closure), or
//! -   one vertex, identical to a vertex of the wire under
//! construction; the other vertex not being
//! geometrically coincident with another vertex of the wire.
//! -   In other cases, when one of the vertices of the edge
//! is simply geometrically coincident with a vertex of the
//! wire under construction (provided that the highest
//! tolerance factor is assigned to the two vertices), the
//! given edge is first copied and the coincident vertex is
//! replaced in this new edge, by the coincident vertex of the wire.
//! Note: it is possible to build non manifold wires using this construction tool.
//! A MakeWire object provides a framework for:
//! -   initializing the construction of a wire,
//! -   adding edges to the wire under construction, and
//! -   consulting the result.
//!
//! A wire may be built :
//!
//! * From a single edge.
//!
//! * From a wire and an edge.
//!
//! - A new wire  is created with the edges  of  the
//! wire + the edge.
//!
//! - If the edge is not connnected  to the wire the
//! flag NotDone   is set and  the  method Wire will
//! raise an error.
//!
//! - The connection may be :
//!
//! . Through an existing vertex. The edge is shared.
//!
//! . Through a geometric coincidence of vertices.
//! The edge is  copied  and the vertices from the
//! edge are  replaced  by  the vertices from  the
//! wire.
//!
//! . The new edge and the connection vertices are
//! kept by the algorithm.
//!
//! * From 2, 3, 4 edges.
//!
//! - A wire is  created from  the first edge, the
//! following edges are added.
//!
//! * From many edges.
//!
//! - The following syntax may be used :
//!
//! BRepLib_MakeWire MW;
//!
//! // for all the edges ...
//! MW.Add(anEdge);
//!
//! TopoDS_Wire W = MW;
