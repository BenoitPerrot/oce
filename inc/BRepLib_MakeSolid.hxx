//! Describes functions to build a solid from shells.
//! A solid is made of one shell, or a series of shells, which
//! do not intersect each other. One of these shells
//! constitutes the outside skin of the solid. It may be closed
//! (a finite solid) or open (an infinite solid). Other shells
//! form hollows (cavities) in these previous ones. Each
//! must bound a closed volume.
//! A MakeSolid object provides a framework for:
//! -   defining and implementing the construction of a solid, and
//! -   consulting the result.
